# Challenge Project: Credit Card Checker

## Description: A fictional company suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. I had the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid using JavaScript. 

### Project Objectives
    + Use JavaScript knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time
    + Use console.log to check output of loops and functions as the project progresses 
    + Use the Luhn algorithm in one of my functions to validate credit cards.
